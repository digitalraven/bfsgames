\\*
Everyone starts moving around, pretending to be amoebas.  Whenever they bump into another player at the same 'level' they play 'rock, paper, scissors' to see who evolves, and who devolves.  Evolution goes 'Amoeba, Frog, Lizard, Rabbit, Monkey, Human' (but can be any levels you choose), acting out each creature.  The winner is whoever reaches the top level of evolution first, or the game ends when everyone becomes human.
