The players divide up into teams of 3-5 people.  One person calls out a number, and each team has to arrange for only that many points of contact with the ground (points are head, hands, feet, bum, etc).  The group works together to reach this goal - for example with 3 people and '4' points, 2 players standing (4 feet down) can lift the other player off the ground.  Large numbers can be as hard as small ones!
