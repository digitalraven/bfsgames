Everyone gets down on their hands and knees with their eyes closed.  An organiser walks round the group and secretly touches one of the players - this person is the 'Silent Cow'.  When the game starts, all the players crawl around the room.  If they bump into another player, they must say 'Moo'.  the silent cow won't moo back, and in this case the player sticks to them, also becoming silent.  Eventually everyone is joined in a lump.
