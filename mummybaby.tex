\play{6 or more in pairs}
\\*
Each pair chooses an animal, and who is going to be the mummy, and who the baby.  The baby closes their eyes, and begins to walk around the space.  The mummy moves some distance away, and leads the baby by 'calling' out that animal noise, making the baby turn to follow that sound.  If the baby is confused, they can also call out, and the mummy must respond straight away.  Players swap round after a while and reverse the trust role.
