Everyone stands in a circle. Sticking out one arm, you count down quickly from 8 to 1, shaking the arm on each count.  Repeat with the other limbs, then repeat again, this time counting from 7 down, then 6 down etc.  At the end of the last round, everyone jumps in the air and shouts 'Rubber Chicken!'
\\*
For variation, count up, start at different numbers, or count down in leaps - e.g 16x, 8x, 4x etc
