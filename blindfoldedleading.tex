\game{Blindfolded Leading}{Focus,Bonding}
\play{6 or more in pairs}
\\*
Each pair chooses one person to close their eyes.  The other player stands behind them, and places one hand on their back or shoulder.  The blindfolded player begins to walk around the space, and the other player uses their other hand to turn them or stop them, avoiding other players and obstacles.  Players swap round after a while and reverse the trust role.
