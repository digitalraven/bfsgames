Everyone forms a circle holding hands, with a small area marked in the middle (about a size for one to stand in). The area is the poison pool and if you touch it then you get fatally poisoned and have to leave the circle. The idea is that as the circle moves slowly around everyone tries to throw their neighbours into the poison pool without being thrown in themselves. Last one left alive wins.
