All but one person knots up in a heap, holding on to each other.  The person out of the heap has to try and unpick each person.  Once they have released a hand, foot, leg etc, the untangled person isn't allowed to re-use that part in tangling.  Once extracted, that person joins in trying to untangle everyone else.
