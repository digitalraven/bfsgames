\\*
Everyone stands in a circle, ready to clap.  The leader claps their hands once, and everyone else must try to clap at the exact same moment so you only hear one clap.\\*
Next, without any leader, the whole group tries to again clap once, all together, without any prompting.\\*
The other variation is known as 'Pass the Clap'.  The group again stands in a cirlce, and the leader claps once, pointing it either left or right.  The clap must move around the circle backwards and forwards, either as fast as possible (easy), or in a set rhythm (harder).  Once this is established, the group can start to move around the space, directing the clp at random to others as they pass, but keeping the rhythm.
