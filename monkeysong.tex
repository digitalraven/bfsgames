Everyone stands in a circle and sing the following song. At the point marked \textit{X}, Somebody calls out a dance move (eg ballet, tango, hip hop etc) and
 everyone does that dance or action. As each 'day' in the song progresses, the original dance plus a new one is done, until by Saturday there are 6 dances. So it continues until Sunday when the monkey is declared dead.
