All players stand in a circle, with one in the middle.  the person in the middle can do a number of things aimed at the other players, to which other players have to respond.  Any player doing the wrong thing, or reacting too slowly gets put in the middle.

\begin{itemize}
\item Say 'Splat' to a person - the 2 players on either side turn in and clap both hands over their head, while they duck out the way.

\item Say 'Bonk!' to a person - that player must freeze while every other player has to duck down.

\item Say 'James Bond' to a person - that player must make a James Bond pose, while the players on either side crouch and caress them, saying 'oooh, James' like Bond girls.

\item Say 'Toast' to a person - the players on either side must turn in and put their arms out like a toaster slot, while the person in the middle jumps like a piece of done toast.

\item Say 'Pyramids' - All players must put their hands over their head in a pyramid and say 'Ommmmmm'.

\item Say 'What are you doing?' to a person - that player must reply with something ending in 'ing' - thinking, reading, walking etc.

\item Say 'House' to a person - that player must crouch down, while the 2 players on either side forma  roof over them with their arms.  The player then says 'come in, come in!' in a sinister voice.
