Everyone stands in a circle, and chants the following song.  At the end of each verse a new body part is used to push the buttons, going hands, feet, head/nose and anything else you fancy!  The final verse, when asked if he is busy, he says 'Yes!'.

\begin{quote}
Hello my name is Joe!
I've got a wife and two kids and I work in the bottle factory.
One day my Boss came up to me.
He said ``Joe, are you busy?'' I said, ``No!''
He said, ``Push this button with your right hand.''
[everyone starts pushing a button with their right hand...]
