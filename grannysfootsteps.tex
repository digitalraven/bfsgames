\\*
One person (Granny) faces a wall with their back to the other players.  The other players line up at one end of the room and must try to sneak up on them.  Granny can turn round at any time, and the players must stand stock still. If Granny sees a player moving, they must move back to the start line.  If a player manages to touch Granny, they take over the role.\\*
For variation, Granny can wander round the room and try to put off or make laugh any of the stationary players (without touching them).\\*
