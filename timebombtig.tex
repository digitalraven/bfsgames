As normal tig, except that players who are tigged become explosive.  they stand with their legs apart and count down slowly from 5.  If they reach zero they 'explode' and collapse to the ground, and are out of the game.  They can be 'rescued' by having another player crawl through their legs before the countdown runs out.  Players can't be tigged while crawling.\\*
Variations include Leapfrog Tig (having to leapfrog over the stuck person) and Toilet Tig (having to sit on them and pretend to use the toilet).
