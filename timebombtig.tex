As normal tig, except that players who are tigged become explosive.  they stand with their legs apart and count down slowly from 5.  If they reach zero they 'explode' and collapse to the ground, and are out of the game.  They can be 'rescued' by having another player crawl through their legs before the countdown runs out.  Players can't be tigged while crawling.

Also known as: Stuck in the Mud, Toilet Tig
