Mark out a small rectangle or square - no one can go outside this space. One person (the snake) lies down in the middle on their belly. Everyone else touches them with just a finger. The snake suddenly moves and tries to touch as many people as possible. Those tigged all become snakes, get down on their bellies and start trying to tig others. Pandemonium ensues until everyone is tigged.
