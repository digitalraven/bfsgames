\equip{Pegs or Scarves}
\\*
Divide the group into two or more sub-groups.  Each group forms a 'conga chain' and attaches a peg or scarf to the last person's back.  Each dragon has to try to steal the peg from the other one.\\*
A variation is to have the head of each dragon try to catch its own tail.\\*
