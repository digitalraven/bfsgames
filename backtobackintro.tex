\\*
Players sit in pairs, back to back.  Each pair has 3-5 minutes to chat and find out things about each other.  The group then reforms and each person has to tell the rest of the group 3-5 facts about the other person.\\*
Variations can include making the person talk for 30 seconds about the other person, or allowing the players to make up fake stories and have the group guess which parts are true/false.
