Groups of players are each given a scene which they have to re-enact by positioning themselves to represent people and objects as if in a photograph.  Examples are scenes out of Fairy Stories, Giving Birth, Making a cup of tea, etc.  Players can represent objects as well as characters, for example furniture or clothing.
