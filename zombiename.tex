\game{Zombie Name Game}{Introduction}
\play{5 or more}
\\*
One player begins shambling towards another, zombie-style.  The targeted player turns to another player, and makes eye contact, then says their name.  They then begin shambling towards them.  If the zombie catches the person before they start moving, they're out of the circle.
