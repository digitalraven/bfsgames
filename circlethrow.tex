\equip{1 or more Balls or Short Sticks}
\\*
Everyone stand in a big circle, one person with a ball (or stick). The person with the ball must catch someone's eye and then throw the ball to them.  This continues at random around the circle.\\*
There are several variations:\\*
Once people are getting fast enough, introduce extra balls.\\*
The person with the ball must say the person's name before throwing it to them.\\*
The person must, after throwing the ball, immediately run around the circle clockwise to the next empty space.  This ends up with most people running all the time.
