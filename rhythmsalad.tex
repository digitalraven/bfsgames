\play{4 or more}
\\*
All the players stand in a circle.  One person begins saying the name of a type of food that can be used to make a salad over and over, in a rhythmic style.  The rest of the group joins in, each picking a different food item (and accompanying rhythm).  The rhythms all mix together to make a 'rhythm salad' beat.  Players can change their item and rhythm at any time.
