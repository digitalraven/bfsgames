Everyone stands in a circle. The first person says ZIP! and points immediately either left or right makes the person left or right.  This person then continues in the same way.  After a few minutes, ZAP! is added - pointing with both hands at anyone in the circle \textit{other} than the person immediately left or right.  Thirdly, BOING! is added - throwing up your arms and 'bouncing' back a ZAP! to the sender.  Next, KER-CHING!, curving your arm over your neighborus head to the next-but-one person is added.  finally, BOING-BALOING! - 'bouncing' back a BOING! which involves both people bouncing across the circle to change spaces.\\*
When someone gets it wrong, they either leave the circle, or they crouch down and form a 'new' circle low down, whose 'losers' stand back up to the higher circle.
