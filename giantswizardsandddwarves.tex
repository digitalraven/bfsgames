\\*
The players divide into 2 teams.  Each team decides each round to be one of the three characters.  Dwarves is to crouch down, put your fingers on your head like little horns and make small noises.  Wizards stand and intone "SHA-ZAM!" whilst casting a spell. Giants hold their hands high and roar.\\*
Wizard beats Giant, Giant beats Dwarf and Dwarf beats Wizard.\\*
The two teams line up, face to face.  Both sides chant 'HO, HA, HO, HA, HO!' and then does their chosen action.  If both sides are the same, they retreat to their 'base' and decide on a new character.  If different, whichever side is the 'winner' chases the losing side, and any they catch (before they reach the safety of their 'base') join their team for the next round.  The game is over when only one team remains, or a certain number of players on one side is reached.\\*
Variations can include using different characters (e.g red, white, blue), animals (e.g cat, mouse, elephant) etc.
