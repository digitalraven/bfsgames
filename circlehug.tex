Everyone forms a long line, holding hands.  One person stands still and everyone else walks or runs around, winding the line up in a big hug.  (Care must be taken not to break anyone's arms!).  Once complete, the middle person crouches down and escapes out under people's arms, with the rest of the line following until it is straight again.
