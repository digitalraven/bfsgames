A good way to let go of negative energy and draw positive energy back - this exercise is best not done until the group is established. Everyone stands in a circle facing in. Everyone draws in a deep breath and puts their arms above their heads. Then, altogether everyone releases the breath and flings their arms/energy in to the centre whilst saying “Esser”. Then on the in-breath, they slowly draw back from the centre saying “Yesser” until they are at full stretch before releasing in to the centre with another “Esser”.  this cycle repeats a few times with the intensity building each time.
