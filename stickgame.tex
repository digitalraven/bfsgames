Players get into pairs, each with a stick in their right hand.  Facing the other player they each put a fingertip or palm onto the end of the stick, and then begin to move around each other, taking care not to drop the stick.  Players can be challenged to try actions like lying down, facing back to back etc.  Once comfortable with this, the players all form one long line, and continue trying to move around without dropping any sticks.
