this is best done in groups of 4, then moved up to larger grids s players develop.  All players stand in a square grid, and turn so that one 'corner' is at the front.  This person can make any movement or action, which must be mirrored by  the people behind.  The most important thing is that the people flocking must only look at the person directly in front of them, not through to the person at the very front.  That way they are using peripheral vision, and can always see what is happening.  Use the movements to rotate the grid so that different people on the outside get to lead the flocking.
