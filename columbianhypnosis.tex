\play{4 or more, in pairs}
\\*
In pairs, each pair chooses a 'leader' who puts their palm flat in front of the other person's face.  As they move their hand around, the other person must keep their face close to it and remain focused on it as if they are hypnotised by it.  After a while, players swap roles.
