One person (Granny) sits on a chair, blindfolded, with a water pistol or balls, with a bunch of keys under the chair.  The other players circle round her some distance away and must try to sneak up and steal the keys.  If she hears them trying she can squirt the water pistol at them/throw a ball at them/hit them with her handbag.  Anyone who is hit has to go back to the outer circle.  If someone manages to get the keys, they become Granny.\\*
