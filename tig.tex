One player is 'it' and has to chase the others.  When another player is tigged, they stop, raise their arm
and shout 'I'm It'. You can play this with some places being 'wood' (like touching a tree or a wall).  Common variastions include 'safe zones' where you can't be tigged and also 'no having back' which means that if you were last IT then you can't be tigged this time.

Also known as 'Catch and Tag'.
