\chapter[Acknowledgements]{\begin{center}Acknowledgements\end{center}}

Many thanks to those members of the Beltane Fire Society community who have created, collected and shared these games, with special thanks to Chlo\"{e} Dear and Tom Gibson for their original collections, on which this book has drawn heavily.

\chapter[Introduction]{\begin{center}Introduction\end{center}}

This book is a collection of games, activities and exercises as used by the Beltane Fire Society in its preparations for Beltane Fire Festival and other events.  These games are both entertaining and practical, focusing on group bonding, movement, trust, exercise with special focus on ritual and artistic interaction.  They have been collected from a wide variety of sources, but mostly distributed by word of mouth, with some forays into recording them for posterity over the years.\\*
This book contains several indexes: \textbf{Contents} contains an alphabetical list of the games for easy reference.  \textbf{Alternatives} at the end gives a list of alternative names that many of these games are known by.  \textbf{Players} lists games by the number of players needed, and \textbf{Categories} sorts the games by Category: Bonding, Focus, Warmup etc.\\*
We hope you enjoy reading and using this book, and that it provides both entertainment and practical skills for you and the groups you are working with!\\*
