Everyone sits down, one behind the other with their legs stretched out in front of them either side of the person in front, with the heavier/stronger people at the front.  On a signal, everyone flips over to their right, so they end up on their hands with their legs resting on the person behind them.  The challenge is then to try to move around like a millipede.
