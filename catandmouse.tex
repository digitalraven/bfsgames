The group is divided up into pairs, and they stand one behind the other.  One pair is split, and one person made the cat, and the other the mouse.  The cat chases the mouse (with full actions/sound effects).  If they catch them, they swap roles.  The mouse can escape from being chased by joining onto the back of one of the other pairs.  The person at the front is pushed off and becomes the cat, the original cat becoming the mouse.\\*
